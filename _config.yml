          The objective of this graduate internship project is to implement an AI model capable of:

            - Analyze a research paper in (editable) .pdf form and extract meaningful content as much as possible;

            - Abstarctively summarizes the extracted contents(mainly text, but could also include tables, pictures, and formulas) and construct the knowledge graph;

            - Generate a slide explaining the paper accordingly. The slide can be used in a presentation or to help understand the original paper;

          Other words: fine tune a large language model for text summarization using Google cloud platform.

          Research similarity metrics(Wasserstein distance) and contribute to python open-source libraries.

            - Implement the Wasserstein distance metric between distributions in python.

            - Contribute to open-source communities such as Scipy.

            - Apply the Wasserstein metric on the client's data for anomaly detection.

          Other words: suggest a [multi dimensional wasserstein_distance function](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/17290) in Scipy and start a PR.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
